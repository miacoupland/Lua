# Lua-Basics
 Learning the basics of Lua through creating basic 2D games using LÃ–VE 2D.
 
 Learning Lua is just a little side hobby because I've taken interest in Linux customisation in the past. I like 'Rainmeter' for desktop customisation and Awesomewm as a Linux window manager. Both make use of Lua, and getting used to the language in this way helps me to make my customisations in a more intuitive way.

'Save the ball' game created using this tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-games-with-love-2d-and-lua/ from FreeCodeCamp.
 - The player moves a ball around the screen to avoid colliding with enemies.
 - There is a menu, pause screen, settings screen, and end screen.
