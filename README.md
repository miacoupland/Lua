# Lua-Basics
 Learning the basics of Lua through creating basic 2D games using LÃ–VE 2D.
 
 Learning Lua is just a little side hobby because I've taken interest in Linux customisation in the past. I like 'Rainmeter' for desktop customisation and Awesomewm as a Linux window manager. Both make use of Lua, and getting used to the language in this way helps me to make my customisations in a more intuitive way.
